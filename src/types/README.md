# UNDERSTANDING THESE TYPES

THIS DOCUMENT HOLDS ALL THE TYPE INFORMATION FOR REQUESTS AND RESPONSES FOR BANQUEST. WHILE RESPONSES SHOULD ALIGN WITH WHAT BANQUEST HAS ON THEIR DOCUMENTATION, THE REQUESTS WILL BE TAILORED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS WE SET FOR THE INFORMATION WE WANT TO SEND TO BANQUEST.

e.g., WHILE AVS INFORMATION FOR VALIDATING CARDS IS AN OPTIONAL FIELD ON BANQUEST, IT WILL BE A REQUIRED FIELD ON OUR END SINCE WE ALWAYS WANT TO CHECK THIS TO REDUCE POTENTIAL FRAUD.

FUTURE DEVELOPERS ARE RECOMMENDED TO READ THE BANQUEST API DOCUMENTATIONS ALONG SIDE THE TYPES MENTIONED IN THIS DOCUMENT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE API WILL WORK.
